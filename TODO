THEME Ascending or Rising

Must Have:
    ☐ @high name the game
    ✔ Walk around with controller @done(21-03-11 21:50)

    Move animals between islands:
        ☐ Spanw/create multiple Islands
        ☐ Calculate weight on Island, lose the Island and Animimals if weight is too much

    ☐ @today shrink islands based on the number of barrels in the sea
    ☐ Make animals fall of ice when too small
    ☐ 0 barels lowers sea and grows ice

    ☐ if water is at certain level, drown and die.
    ☐ or if all the animals are dead
        
    ☐ After surviving a certain amount of time you go to the next level
        ✔ Spawn barrel behind boat. @done(21-03-11 21:17)

    ☐ Title Screen
    ☐ Game over screen
    ☐ be able to restart
    ☐ Credits -> highlight all subs during gamejam

Should Have:    
    ☐ prevent walking off the earth
    ☐ make sea bigger, add fog
    ☐ Animations of dying animals
    ☐ Generate Levels
        ~ Maybe hard code a couple and show them if needed
        ~ Or create some sort of config and generate when needed                
    ☐ Music
    ☐ sound fx
    ☐ animation when water lever rises

Could Have:
    ☐ Picking up barrels and drop them in a specific place

Would Like:
    ☐ Physics (physX, add later maybe after gamejam) 
    ☐ Some shader trick when looking under water.

@critical Bugs:
    ☐ Can't pick up barrels



Questions:
    ☐ What happens when you drop a barrel on the ice?

- Sea level / Global Warming
    ~ Save polarbears and pinguins (seals)
    ~ they are on little pieces of Ice that shrink
        over time and you have to save them.
    ~ god view (like populous)
    ~ rules: 
        - water rises when trash is in water and ice melts
        - 1 polarbear weighs 10 pinguins
        - Ice is lower in the water by weight        
        - clean the ocean of rubbish
            ~ boats drop trash in the ocean making the 
                water rise.
            ~ when boats sink it releases a lot of trash in 
                the water
    ~ challenges:
        - Ices that shrinks.
            ~ maybe slowly scale it down

- Leaking submarine
    ~ room scale
    ~ little challenges like among us to do in a room
        before the water gets to high.
    ~ doing thing wrong, increases speed of rising water
    ~ challenges:
        - Water
        - a lot of different mini games.
        - Creating graphics

    - Escalator / Stair
    - Stars  / pop stars
    - helium baloons 
  
    - Rockets / Firework
        ~ design a show
    - Zombies rising from their graves
    - Mont St. Michel - rising tides
        ~ keep your castle from flooding
        
    - Climb a mountain without drowning
        ~ Find your way up before the water catches you
        ~ Stairs
        ~ open floodgates by doing 'challenges'
    - join the maffia and rise to the top
    - rebuild of descent.
