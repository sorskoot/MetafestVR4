- Sea level / Global Warming
    ~ Save polarbears and pinguins (seals)
    ~ they are on little pieces of Ice that shrink
        over time and you have to save them.
    ~ god view (like populous)
    ~ rules: 
        - water rises when trash is in water and ice melts
        - 1 polarbear weighs 10 pinguins
        - Ice is lower in the water by weight        
        - clean the ocean of rubbish
            ~ boats drop trash in the ocean making the 
                water rise.
            ~ when boats sink it releases a lot of trash in 
                the water
    ~ challenges:
        - Ices that shrinks.
            ~ maybe slowly scale it down





- Leaking submarine
    ~ room scale
    ~ little challenges like among us to do in a room
        before the water gets to high.
    ~ doing thing wrong, increases speed of rising water
    ~ challenges:
        - Water
